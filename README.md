### Credits

* Kaphotics and SciresM for PKHeX, on which this software is heavily based. Without their legality checking APIs, this couldn't exist anytime soon.
* ArchitDate, which provided his PKHeX [AutoLegality-mod](https://github.com/architdate/PKHeX-Auto-Legality-Mod/). Without his legality work, this couldn't exist anytime soon.
